# UE Render Tools

All assets are compatible with Unreal Engine 5.2.1. They might not work with previous version as is.
These are the materials, material functions & settings I have used in the past.
They are a good starting point to understand and work with material and Unreal.

A global overview is also available on [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/39ZKPD).

## How to

Copy the UERenderTools folder inside your Content folder.
To access MovieRenderQueue settings enable the plugin.

#### SetupCVars

Allows to change some CVars at runtime. They are pretty limited to what I needed but the idea is usefull.

The plugin needs to be activated for the assets to be opened.

They only have been tested on UE 5.1
